Interactive MESA Plotter (IMP for short) is a simple piece of software for python3 that produces interactive plots from MESA history files. All of the data contained in a history file is loaded into the interactive plot, so that any quantity can be plotted against any other instantaneously. No more making a new plot just because you want to zoom in on a particular region or have a different quantity on the axes!

The plots are made using the python library Bokeh and are outputted as .html files which can be viewed in any web browser or shared online.


For instructions, refer to the jupyter notebook file Guide.ipynb (also provided as .html file).
